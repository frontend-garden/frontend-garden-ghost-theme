// 1. Set container width in `em` so line length doesn't get shorter while viewport grows bigger.
//    As a side effect, code blocks are a bit narrower than body text because their font size is
//    smaller. However it doesn't look bad s let's not worry about it and promote it to a design
//    decision.
// 2. We also use `em` for container padding so the line length doesn't get shorter when viewport is
//    growing (like it would with `vw` for example).

$container-width: 78em; // 1.
$container-padding: 1.25rem; // 2.
$container-padding-sm: 2.25em; // 2.

$container-narrow-width: $container-width * 2/3;
$container-article-width: $container-width / 2;
